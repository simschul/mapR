# mapR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of mapR is to provide some simple functions that help you mapping categories from one classification into another classification. 

**Note**: No liability assumed. Currently only implemented so that it fulfills my purpose. Might become a more general R package at some time...

## Installation

You can install the development version of mapR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("simschul/mapR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
#library(mapR)
## basic example code
```
